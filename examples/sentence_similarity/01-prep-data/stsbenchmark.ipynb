    "Removing stop words is another common preprocessing step for NLP tasks. We use the `rm_spacy_stopwords` utility function to do this on the dataframe. This function makes use of the spaCy language model's default set of stop words. If we need to add our own set of stop words (for example, if we are doing an NLP task for a very specific domain of content), we can do this in-line by simply providing the list as the `custom_stopwords` parameter of `rm_spacy_stopwords`."
