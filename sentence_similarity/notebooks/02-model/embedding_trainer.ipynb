Word embeddings are learned such that words that share common contexts in the corpus will be close together in the vector space. There are two different model architectures that can be used to produce word2vec embeddings: continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) or continuous skip-gram. The former uses a window of surrounding words (the \"context\") to predict the current word and the latter uses the current word to predict the surrounding context words. See this [tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/word-embedding-word2vec.html#3) on word2vec for more detailed background on the model."

Conversely, fastText assumes that words are formed by an n-gram of characters (i.e. 2-grams of the word \"language\" would be {la, an, ng, gu, ua, ag, ge}). The embedding for a word is then composed of the sum of these character n-grams. This has advantages when finding word embeddings for rare words and words not present in the dictionary, as these words can still be broken down into character n-grams. Typically, for smaller datasets, fastText performs better than word2vec or GloVe. See this [tutorial](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/unsupervised-tutorial.html) on fastText for more detail."
