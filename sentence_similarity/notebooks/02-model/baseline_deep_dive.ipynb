    "\n",
    "Producing a baseline model is crucial for evaluating your model's performance on any machine learning problem. A baseline model is a basic solution to a machine learning problem that serves as a point of reference for comparing other models to. The baselines model's performance gives us an indication of how much better our models can perform relative to a naive approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are building a sentence similarity model where our training set contains pairs of sentences and we want to predict how similiar these sentences are on a scale from 1-5. We could spend months producing a complex machine learning solution to this problem and ultimately get a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.4. But is this result good or bad? There is no way of knowing without comparing it with some baseline performance. For our baseline model, we could predict the mean sentence similarity of sentence pairs in our training set (called the _zero rule_) and get a MSE of 0.2. So our model beats the baseline! If our model's performance was worse than the baseline, this might give us pause to consider using different features, models, evaluation metrics etc. It is crucial that the choice of baseline model be tailored to a data science problem based on buisness goals and the specific modeling task."

    "### What are good baselines for sentence similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "For sentence similarity problems, we have two sub-tasks: 1) First, we need to produce a representation of each sentence in the sentence pair. This representation is called an **embedding**. This embedding allows us to represent a sentence with numbers versus words. Specifically, we're learning an n-dimensional vector of numbers that can represent the given sentence. 2) Second, we need to compute the similarity between these two sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For producing representations of sentences, there are some common baseline approaches: \n",
    "1. Create word embeddings for each word in a sentence\n",
    "    1. word2vec word embeddings\n",
    "    2. GLoVe word embeddings\n",

    "2. Create sentence embeddings\n",

    "1. Word Embedding comparison\n",
    "    1. Cosine Similarity (first requires averaging the word embeddings of all words in each sentence)\n",

    "Word2vec is a predictive model for learning word embeddings from text. Word embeddings are learned such that words that share common contexts in the corpus will be close together in the vector space. There are two different model architectures that can be used to produce word2vec embeddings: continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) or continuous skip-gram. The former uses a window of surrounding words (the \"context\") to predict the current word and the latter uses the current word to predict the surrounding context words. See this [tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/word-embedding-word2vec.html#3) on word2vec for more detailed background on the model.\n",

The weight \" increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus\" ([tutorial link](http://www.tfidf.com/)). When we're averaging together many different word vectors to get a sentence embedding, it makes sense to give stronger weight to words that are more distinct relative to the corpus and that have a high frequency in the sentence.

    "fastText is an unsupervised algorithm created by Facebook Research for efficiently learning word embeddings. fastText is significantly different than word2vec or GloVe in that these two algorithms we saw earlier treat each word as the smallest possible unit to find an embedding for. Conversely, fastText assumes that words are formed by an n-gram of characters (i.e. 2-grams of the word \"language\" would be {la, an, ng, gu, ua, ag, ge}). The embedding for a word is then composed of the sum of these character n-grams. This has advantages when finding word embeddings for rare words and words not present in the dictionary, as these words can still be broken down into character n-grams. Typically, for smaller datasets, fastText performs better than word2vec or GloVe. See this [tutorial](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/unsupervised-tutorial.html) on fastText for more detail. We will use the pretrained word embeddings for the English language (wiki.en.bin; these embeddings as well as embeddings for 293 other languages can be found [here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html)).
